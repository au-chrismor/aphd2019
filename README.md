# Active Pedestrian Hazard Detection (APHD) for InnovateFPGA 2019

The code in this repository forms part of our submission to the Terasic / Intel InnovateFPGA 2019 design contest.

## Synopsis

APHD is an appliance intended to alert the driver of a vehicle to the risk of pedestrian collision.  It does so through the use of multiple cameras, image recognition and learning processes.  In addition, an Intel Cyclone V FPGA device is used to accelerate processing.
